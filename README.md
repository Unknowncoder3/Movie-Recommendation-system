# 📚 Book Recommender System

An **intelligent book recommendation system** built using **machine learning techniques** to suggest books based on user preferences and similarity between books.

This project demonstrates **data preprocessing, feature engineering, similarity-based recommendation, and real-world ML workflow**.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

The Book Recommender System analyzes historical user–book interaction data and recommends books using **collaborative filtering techniques**.

It helps users:
- Discover new books
- Find books similar to their interests
- Improve reading recommendations using data-driven methods

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Approach

### ✔ Collaborative Filtering
- Uses **user–item interaction patterns**
- Recommends books based on similarity scores
- Learns from past user ratings

### ✔ Similarity Computation
- Cosine similarity on vectorized data
- Identifies closely related books

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### Programming Language
- Python

### Libraries & Tools
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

📊 Dataset

Dataset contains:

Book titles

User ratings

User IDs

Data is preprocessed to remove noise and sparsity.

🧪 Example Output

Input: Book Title

Output: Top N similar book recommendations

🎯 Learning Outcomes

Implemented collaborative filtering from scratch

Understood similarity-based recommendation systems

Worked with real-world datasets

Applied machine learning concepts end-to-end

🚀 Future Improvements

Add content-based filtering

Build a web interface (Streamlit / Flask)

Add user authentication

Deploy the model
