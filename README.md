## 🎯 Problem Statement

With thousands of movies available across platforms, users often struggle to decide **what to watch next**.
Traditional search-based systems fail to capture **content similarity and user taste** effectively.

---

## 💡 Solution

This project implements a **Content-Based Movie Recommendation System** that recommends movies based on **semantic similarity of movie metadata**.

The system is built using **machine learning techniques** and deployed as a **production-ready Streamlit web application** for real-time interaction.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

* 🎥 Movie recommendations based on content similarity
* 🧠 TF-IDF vectorization of movie metadata
* 📐 Cosine similarity for ranking recommendations along with more advancements.
* 🔍 Fuzzy matching for user-friendly movie search
* 🌐 Fully deployed on **Streamlit Cloud**
* ⚡ Fast & optimized using Streamlit caching

---

## 🧠 Recommendation Approach

### 🔹 Content-Based Filtering

* Uses movie metadata such as:

  * Genres
  * Keywords
  * Cast
  * Director
  * Tagline
* Text features are vectorized using **TF-IDF**
* Similarity between movies is computed using **cosine similarity**

### 🔹 Why Content-Based?

* No user login required
* Works well for niche movies
* Easy to scale and deploy
* Ideal for cold-start scenarios
